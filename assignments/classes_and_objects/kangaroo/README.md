# Kangaroo Class

Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
- An `__init__` method that initializes an attribute named `pouch_contents` to an empty list.
- A method named `put_in_pouch` that takes an object of any type and adds it to pouch_contents.
- A `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the `Kangaroo` object and the contents of the pouch.

Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
