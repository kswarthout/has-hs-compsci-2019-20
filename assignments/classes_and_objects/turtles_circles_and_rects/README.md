# Turtle Circles & Rects!

Use the shape classes previously defined to create functions that draw circles and rectangles using object instances

## `draw_rect`
Write a function called **draw_rect** that takes Turtle and Rectangle objects and uses the Turtle to draw a rectangle on the canvas.

## `draw_circle`
Write a function called **draw_circle** that takes Turtle and Circle objects and draws a circle on the canvas. Be mindful of where to position the turtle before you begin your circle command (hint: the circle's center is always radius units left of the turtle).
